# Hello!

My name is Arltan Dordzhiev, i am 23. I graduated from KalmSU with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. During my training, I learned programming languages such as Pascal, Delphi, and The latex mathematical text layout program. Here is a simple example of the code we were taught to write in Pascal: 
```
var a, b, c, D, x1, x2, k: real;
begin
 writeln('Введите A, B, C');
 readln(a,b,c);
 D:=sqr(b)-4*a*c;
 k:=sqrt(D);
 writeln('Дискриминант:', D);
 if k>0 then x1:=(-b+k)/(2*a);
 begin x2:=(-b-k)/(2*a); end;
 if k=0 then x1:=-b/(2*a);
 if k<0 then writeln('Корней нет');
writeln('Первый корень:', x1, ' Второй корень:', x2);
end.
```
I learn everything quickly, and also have such qualities as:
* responsibility
* diligence
* resourcefulness.
